## Introduction
<br>
<p style='font-family:"Roboto"; font-size:17px;'>Stablecoins are cryptocurrency assets whose values are relatively stable and non-volatile. They are backed by certain colleteral which can exist off-chain(ex: USDC is pegged to USD ) or collateral which exists on chain(ex: UST which is backed by LUNA ). Stability is achieved chiefly in two major ways; by either making the asset governed or algorithmic. Governed method of stability makes it more centralized and the algorithmic method requires a permissionless algorithm to achieve stability. </p>

<p style='font-family:"Roboto"; font-size:17px;'>In this project I aim to build a stablecoin which is pegged to the USD, algorithmic and exogenous.</p>

1. <p style='font-family:"Roboto"; font-size:17px;'>Relative stability : Anchored or pegged => 1$</p>
2. <p style='font-family:"Roboto"; font-size:17px;'>Stability mechanism(Minting) : Algorithmic (Decentralized)</p>
3. <p style='font-family:"Roboto"; font-size:17px;'> Collateral : Exogenous(Crypto)</p>
